Bugs/Incompletes
----------------

 * Not really honoring sfixed32 -- we write out as varint instead of min size 32
   (should probably use unsigned write as passthrough?)
 * Default without value not supported (type-implied default values)
 * Enum is not terribly crazy about enforcing the value is within range
